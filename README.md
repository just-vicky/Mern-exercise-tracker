Verify you have Node.js installed on your system by typing the following on the command line:

### `node -v`

## Backend
Inside the root folder (“mern-exercise-tracker”), change into the folder by running the following commands in the terminal:
### `cd backend`

We’ll create a package.json file inside the folder by running:
### `npm init -y`

Now we can install a few dependencies:
### `npm install express cors mongoose dotenv`

Install Nodemon package globally:
### `npm install -g nodemon`

Now we can start the server by using nodemon inside backend folder using:
### `nodemon server`

Then return to the root folder:
### `cd ../`

## Frontend
Start the webserver inside the root folder:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
